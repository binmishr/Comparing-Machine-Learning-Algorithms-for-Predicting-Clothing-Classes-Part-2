A Brief Introduction
======================
The data was explored, prepared the data for analysis and learned how to predict the clothing categories of the Fashion MNIST data using my go-to model: an artificial neural network in Python. In this second blog post, we will perform dimension reduction on the data in order to make it feasible to run standard machine learning models (including tree-based methods and support vector machines) in the future. The R code for the first post can be found on this repository.
